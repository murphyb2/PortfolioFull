# Hiking Trail Finder

An app which leverages the Hiking Project Data API, Google GeoCode API, and Google Maps API to take a user submitted location and find hiking trails nearby.
This was designed as a way to build more of my front end development skill as well as get more experience interfacing with public APIs and data.

## Deployment

This web app is deployed as an app within the main DevPortfolio project

## Built With

- [Hiking Project Data API](https://www.hikingproject.com/data) - Data source for nearby hiking trails and information
